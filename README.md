# Python Fundamentals

Learning Python from the ground up as the foundation for ML/AI engineering.

## Background

Coming from 35 years of C#/.NET enterprise development, learning Python's philosophy and idioms for machine learning work.

## Learning Goals

- Master Python syntax and core concepts
- Understand data structures (lists, dicts, tuples, sets)
- Learn list/dict comprehensions
- Get comfortable with NumPy and Pandas
- Set up proper development environment

## Structure
```

  ├── day1_basics.py          # Variables, types, operators
  ├── day2_control_flow.py    # Loops, conditionals
  ├── day3_functions.py       # Functions, lambdas, scope
  ├── day4_data_structures.py # Lists, dicts, tuples, sets
  ├── day5_comprehensions.py  # List/dict comprehensions
  └── README.md

  └── data_filter/            # Mini-project: data transformation
```

## Key Learnings

**Python vs C#:**
- Dynamic typing vs static typing
- Duck typing vs interfaces
- Indentation as syntax
- List comprehensions (powerful and Pythonic)
- Everything is an object (including functions)

**Tools:**
- VS Code with Python extension
- Virtual environments (venv)
- Jupyter notebooks
- Git for version control

## Next Steps

After fundamentals: Build neural network from scratch in NumPy (Weeks 3-4)
